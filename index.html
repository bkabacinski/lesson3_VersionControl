            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is like a digital record book of a team’s or an individual’s files. It keeps track of who makes changes to files, when they were changed, what about the file was changed and merge changes to a file. This is very useful when working on a project that involves multiple files. Using a VCS is beneficial because files can’t be overwritten, all files can be found in one common repository, files can be changed back to their previous versions, team members can edit files on their individual devices simultaneously, and files are backed up to prevent them from getting lost.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local VCS keeps all versions of a file in one database. This is a more efficient alternative to copying files in different directories, which could result in user’s losing track of what directory they stored a file in. To make collaboration between users working on the same project easier, centralized version control systems were created. A centralized VCS allows multiple users to check out files from a single database and store updated versions of files on that same database. In a distributed VCS, each user has a copy of the main repository with all the files so that the data can be restored if there are any malfunctions with the main repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed VCS that takes a snapshot of a file when it is saved and use a link to the previous snapshot of a file if no changes are made. What makes Git different from other version control systems is that rather than saving a file each time changes are made to the original version, it saves a visual of the file when it’s changed. Companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter use Git because of its speed and efficiency with projects. Using Git is also convenient because it needs local files for most of its operations, so everything can be accessed from a user’s personal device.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three states of Git that a file can be in are committed, modified and staged. When a file is committed its data is stored on a local database, which is usually your Git directory. A file is in the modified state when changes have been made to it but it hasn’t been committed to your database. Files are modified in the working directory where files can be pulled from their database in order to be modified. In the staged state, a snapshot is taken of the modified file so it can be committed to the database. Files are usually modified, then staged and then committed. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three Main Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Though there are many Git commands that can be used to perform different tasks, the three main commands that will be used in class throughout the semester are git add, git commit and git push. The git add command moves the modified files to the staged state, and can be thought of as a shopping cart of files. To put the modified files in the local repository, the git commit command is used. Git commit is like buying the items you have in your shopping cart. The git push command moves files from the local repository to the remote repository.</p>
